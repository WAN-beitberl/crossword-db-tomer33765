1. The information that is stored in a table is the information about the words in 
   the crossword. That information should be stored in a table because there are
   a lot of words that are used in the website and they share the same qualities.

2. The information that is not stored in a table should be the information that is
   a singular entity, like the matrix of the crossword, the player's score and more.

3. The information is stored in two different tables - a table for words written 
   downwards, and a table for words written across. Each table has 5 columns:
   number of the word, the hint, the word itself, the length of the word, and a 
   boolean value that answers if the user has already guessed correctly.
   All of that is shown in the diagram.

4. CREATE TABLE Across(Num INT, Hint TEXT, Word TEXT, Length INT, IsSolved BOOL);
   CREATE TABLE Down(Num INT, Hint TEXT, Word TEXT, Length INT, IsSolved BOOL);
   INSERT INTO Down VALUES(1, "Mexican food", "Taco", 4, FALSE);
   INSERT INTO Down VALUES(2, "Mexican food", "Churro", 6, FALSE);
   INSERT INTO Across VALUES(1, "A smart animal", "Orangutan", 9, FALSE);
   INSERT INTO Across VALUES(2, "Something that burns", "Fire", 4, FALSE);
   SELECT * FROM Across;
   SELECT * FROM Dowm;
